Limitation of our liability
You are responsible for ensuring that the platform is suitable for your needs. The purpose of Goodat is to enable job seekers to play our quizzes, set up their profiles, identify job opportunities which may be relevant, and provide their personal information to prospective employers and others third parties.

Certain features of Goodat set up time limits and other restrictions, and may require an active connection to the Internet. For example, you will basically have opportunities to complete a particular quiz through the App only once, so unless instructions through the App indicate otherwise, you should make sure that your device set on appropriate modes to ensure you are not interrupted by any event such as telephone call, text message or other alert, and also ensure you are in a calm environment where you will not be interrupted for the duration of the quiz.  Once you have completed a quiz, you will need an active Internet connection in order to be matched with potential employers, and to share your information with them.

We have no control over the decisions made by any prospective employers when reviewing the information you submit through Goodat. If you have any concerns related to the conduct of any such employers please contact them in the first instance. By using Goodat, you warrant that all information you submit:

shall be truthful, accurate and complete to the best of your knowledge;
shall be supplied by you and not by any other party, whether directly or indirectly (so, you should not ask a friend or any other individual to help you complete quizzes through the App);
shall not infringe the rights of any third party (so, you should not copy information from any source).
Please note that, for the avoidance of doubt, the above obligations are subject to some indemnities, which means that you agree to compensate us if we are subject to any claims, damages, expenses, costs and liabilities (including legal fees) which arise from your breach of those obligations.

You may use Goodat exclusively for lawful purposes. You may not use Goodat:
